# Tuple Tunes
### Jacky Luong, Irene Huang, Joyce Yuan, Brandon Lei, Jan Park

Tuple Tunes is a multiplayer game where you can use your ESP32 microcontroller to join an online turn-based game to create a piece of music with other people! The music composition offers a range of notes across three octaves to choose from, a variety of note durations, all possible keys, as well as playback options to see what your group has come up with so far.

Created as our final project for 6.08 (Intro to EECS via Interconnected Embedded Systems).
