**6.08 Final Project Proposalk**

Meeting time: 4:30 - 5:00 PM Thursday

# Several Paragraph Overview
Music Maker:
Our goal is to create a multiplayer music making game, where a group of players can compose a melody together, view their previous games, browse others’ music, and hear their own melodies played from their very own ESP32. Our music maker will also feature a method for players to view their previous music, play their songs on the ESP32, and browse others’ music.

Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to provide an entertaining music making experience accessible to all. Oftentimes, music making platforms are difficult to access and have a steep learning curve. In our case, we are lowering this barrier by creating a game where people can experiment with creating music no matter their previous musical background, and take ownership of the music they create. We believe that music is something people can learn through experimenting, and our game serves the purpose of allowing others to experiment composing music in an intuitive way. In addition, players can learn from each other, share their creations with others, and bond over the music they create. We hope to be able to provide a fun game where people can learn to compose music with each other, and spread their love for music.

Overview of Rules:
Game requirements:
* Up to 10 players
* ESP32 with appropriate code
* WiFi connection
Game Setup:
* Each game room will be associated with a specified key signature and tempo specified by the game host
* Each game room will have an automatically generated game code
* Other players can join the game code by providing a username and the specified game code
In Game Play:
* Players will take turns composing music and adding to a song of their own creation. 
* Upon a player’s turn, he/she will be able to listen to a playthrough of the current song. Then, he/she will have a chance to add up to 16 sixteenth notes (one measure in the default 4/4 time signature) onto the current song
    * The player can choose the note
    * The player can choose the duration
    * The player can choose to add sharps or flats
    * The player can use to pass their turn
    * The player can also access the gameplay menu, where they can view the information for the current game, replay the song, leave game, etc
*When everyone passes on their turn, then the game is over. The song will be finalized and written into the database. This can be accessible to all players in the future.

Backend (server)
Database
Players Table - game id, player username, measure
Games Table - room number, key, tempo, game_status (waiting, started, ended)
Measures Table - player_id, game_id, measure_number_in_game, note_1, note_2 (text)… 

game.py
One game goes on at a time (joining mid-game makes you a spectator, so for each player, identify them as player or spectator)
Fixed number of measures, game ends after all measures are filled and saved into database

Technical Challenges
ESP 32 Frontend Visuals
Grid and space allocation



Attaching each user to a specific identifier
If we let the server side randomly generate a key identifier for each player, then the player will not have access to their data after they disconnect, and will not be able to retrieve 
If we have the user hardcode their username into the C++ code, we need all users to be able to use C++ and go in to change their own username
If we let users input their own username, there also exists a problem of users sharing the same name, and overriding data for each other

Connecting Hardware and Software
We are unfamiliar with how the new parts work, especially the joystick. There may be difficulty in the wiring and difficulty in the accuracy in querying the data.
Especially regarding new parts such as the Joystick

Multi-player
Coordinating database querying and several players
Time delays / latency / HTTP requests blocking code
Updating every user with most recent game state
Division of Work
We plan on each contributing to each section, with point people who will plan to focus on certain areas.

Each week, we will assign specific tasks to each individual;
