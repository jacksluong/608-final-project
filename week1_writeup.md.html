# Goal 1: Complete frontend for landing page and join/create game pages on ESP side

We completed the frontend for a loading page prior to a landing page, which displays options for starting a new game, joining a game, and a gallery. Based on the user’s selection (using a joystick and button), it leads the user to the appropriate next page. In the Start Game page, it displays the option to set a key and tempo, as well as a start option and back option (to return to the landing page). In the Join Game page, it prompts the user to input a room number using the joystick, and the option to join the game or back (return to the landing page). In both the Start and Join game pages, a cursor is beside the option the user is currently on, and the cursor blinks when the user is locked into choosing a key, tempo, or room number.

# Goal 2:  Complete controls of the pre-game system (changing the state of system with hardware)

The joystick and button are fully functional, changing the state of the system as desired. The joystick is able to navigate through each of the pre-game menu pages (up and down between different options, different selections for each option—like what key and tempo for starting a new game). The button is able to properly select options and lock on to them or trigger a page change.

# Goal 3: Complete frontend for in game (player in and off turn)

The in-game display properly displays a grid representing the notes in a single measure as well as the measure number above it and an example note in the measure. It also displays the controls the players can see in the right sidebar. A cursor indicates which quarter-beat in the measure the player is currently on.

# Goal 4: Make significant progress on frontend and backend (state machine) for in-game menu

The frontend for in-game displays a 4x4 grid for the 16 notes in each measure, and the frontend for the menu displays the menu options. In the in-game, a cursor that blinks at the current note and locks at a short button press and enters the menu at a long button press. In the menu, a cursor scrolls through the menu options using the joystick. Currently we have the functionality to return to the in game display by clicking a short press when the cursor is on "Resume" as well as the functionality to return to the landing page by a short press when the cursor is on "Leave Game." The right side includes static info for the frontend display of menu information.

# Goal 5: Set up database tables and server requests.

We have brainstormed through the logic of all the requests and databases of our game, and set up the python code on the server side of things. Specifically, we have a few different python scripts within our server repository: init.py, which handles the initial get and post requests; logic.py, which handles the in game data fetching; start_functions.py, which sets up our database tables (respectively a games table, players table, and measures table; and in_game_functions.py, which handles in game logic functions. In this way, we can play a dummy version of our game through get and post requests on postman.

# Additional progress:

We were able to begin using the buzzer in the Start Game page by briefly playing the note when choosing a key.

# Next Steps:

Our goals for next week are:
* Complete functionality to select a note and connect data from ESP to the server side via POST / GET requests
* Output sound on speaker
* Have a sandbox version of the game working (one player is able to query through the different tunes, hear each)
* Connect transitions between pages when game is operating
* Complete feature to show previous measures on frontend
* End a game
